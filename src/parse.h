/**
 * @brief Reads data from a given stream, parses it to extract CIDR blocks,

 *
 * This function reads the input stream line by line, and for each line,
 * it attempts to match and extract CIDR blocks using a regular expression.
 * The extracted CIDR blocks are stored in a ParsedData structure, which is returned
 * upon completion of the function. It handles potential line splits by keeping
 * any remaining part of a line in a buffer till it is fully parsed in subsequent read operations.
 *
 * @param stream The input file stream to read data from.
 * @return ParsedData structure containing all the parsed CIDR blocks.
 *
 * @note If memory allocation fails, the function prints an error message and exits the program.
